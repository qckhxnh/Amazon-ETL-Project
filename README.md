**AMAZON WEB SCRAPING PROJECT**

Amazon is a major player in the global tech industry, continuously evolving and shaping the way people shop and consume content online. Keep in mind that there may have been further developments or changes since then. 

In this project, I utilized Python's libraries BeautifulSoup and requests to perform webscraping on the Amazon website. These data will later be loaded in to local databases for further analysis.
